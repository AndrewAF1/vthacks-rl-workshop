## Setting up the System

This project relies on python and jupyter notebooks, a really cool way to create interactive documents with Python. The easiest way to set up dependencies with any python installation (Windows, Mac, or Linux) is with `pip`, a Python package manager. This workshop assumes you have a working python installation that includes `pip`. Directions for installing python can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have a working python installation, you need to install the dependencies that we will need for the workshop. Note, some of these are large, so it would be good to do this process before the workshop begins. We have provided a file that contains the names of all of our dependencies for this project. To install these packages, simply run this command in your terminal/command prompt from inside this repository:

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
 Once this is finished running, you should be able to run `jupyter notebook` in your command prompt/terminal and gain access to the workshop! Enjoy!
